## Projects
### [The Epitome of Elements](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Eh5Sa47Tl942rzQ5q_7bNNbvOBD0rVSt?usp=drive_link)
Epitome of Elements is a Thesis project based game developed by three (3) members. It is a 2D Pixel Typing RPG Game which uses a keyboard in order to type as its main combat system. The game was developed using Unity (2D) with C# as its scripting language. I was tasked and reposible for creating and animating the game's sprites and enemies. I also did some testing and debugging of all sorts during the gameplay.
